            On the vibrant 19th of May 2005,I,<strong><b>Kristine Joy Balazuela Igang</strong></b>, came into this world in the lively Manga District of Tagbilaran City. My family, a source of immense love and support, hails from the picturesque town of San Vicente in Maribojoc, Bohol. Early on, my journey into education began at Lincod Elementary School, where my fascination with numbers and the intricate world of mathematics took root. Moving forward, my time at Saint Vincent Institute allowed me to delve into my interests in accountancy and business management during my junior and senior high school years. Currently, I am pursuing my dreams of becoming a Computer Engineer at the esteemed university of Bohol, immersing myself in the exciting realm of technology.

Whether immersed in literature as both a reader and writer, experimenting with flavors and creating culinary delights, or expressing myself through music, my creative outlets are diverse. Through it all, my family remains my anchor, providing unwavering support and inspiration. Together with my younger sister, Krissel Balazuela Igang, we navigate life journey, building a bond that weaves through time.
